This is a collection of Chinese cultural books and attempts to provide its various forms of projects.

Typography is a simple arrangement based on personal preferences.

At present, in some ancient books, because some uncharacterized Chinese characters are not currently played, use "(Left X Right X)" this form of record. In the future, we will pick out the energy and try to change it back to a single Chinese character according to the original text.

Warmhearted people are welcome to join this work! ^_^

Current work required:

- Continue to add new ancient books and their content
- Make .mobi files based on .epub files (personal use Calibre<sup>&copy;</sup>)
- Fix temporary Chinese characters in the document
- Generate more document types

Personal work is not easy, you need your support~
